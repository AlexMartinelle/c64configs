Simple repo for keeping and sharing your (CJM) config files for the C64mini

For more info, see the [C64 mini documentation](https://thec64.com/file-loader/)

For convenience, lets try to keep these organised alphabetically, and stick with the convention that was used on the FW8Bit SD2IEC cards - i.e. create a folder with the name of the game, in lowercase, with _ instead of spaces (eg bruce_lee)

If the title begins with 'The', then that goes at the end (eg last_ninja_the).

Anyone can contribute, let's share our configs!  Dont put the d64, crt, tap etc images here.
